      <p><strong>16th February, 2025</strong></p>
        <p>
          Lover Fest felt like a dream with you, but the most magical part was our moment — our own little 'Lover' moment.  
          That tight hug, the warmth, the comfort — it didn’t feel like a first meeting; it felt like home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything about you was just perfect — your kindness, your voice, your smile, your eyes — and then you showed up in my favorite color, stealing my heart effortlessly, like a lyric written just for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          If time could pause, I’d choose that moment over and over again.  
          Thank you so much, Ms. Beauty, for coming into my life!! 💖

      <p>To Utk, my little secret whispering magic,</p>
        <p>
          You walked into my life on a random February day,  
          but since then, nothing’s felt random at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’ve become my calm in chaos,  
          the smile I search for in the noise,  
          and the silence that feels full when you're near.
        </p>
        <p>
          In your laughter, I’ve found music.  
          In your voice, a sense of home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even our little fights… they carry warmth,  
          because they end with us understanding each other even more.
        </p>
        <p>
          You've seen me — the raw, messy, unfiltered me.  
          And yet, you stayed.  
          That means more to me than words can ever spell out.
        </p>
        <p>
          With you, I’ve felt what it means to be alive.  
          To be wanted.  
          To be held — not just in arms, but in heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          So here’s to you —  
          The one who turned my ordinary into something quietly magical.
        </p>
        <p>Happy Birthday, Bebu ❣️</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="letter-popup" id="letter3">
    <div class="popup-content">
      <span class="close" onclick="closeLetter('letter3')">&times;</span>
      <p>
          You’re chaotic, expressive, loving, annoying, sweet — and everything in between.  
          You tease, you pout, you comfort, you demand.  
          You ask for too many kisses and then complain when I give just one.
        </p>
        <p>
          But most of all, you make me feel like I’m wanted.  
          And that’s something rare.
        </p>
        <p>
          From “Ms. Beauty” to “my safe place,”  
          you’ve become this rhythm in my everyday life — the voice in my head that sounds like mischief and love.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re weird. We fight. We vibe.  
          We forgive. We repeat.  
          And that loop? Feels like home.
        </p>
        <p>
          I won’t say future, forever, or always.  
          I’ll just say — right now, you’ve made my world softer.  
          And that’s enough to write a love song about 💛
        </p>

      <p>
  Hey,
</p>

<p><strong>
  I never thought I’d reach a point where expressing how I feel would hurt this much.</strong></p>
<p>
   I gave everything I could to keep us alive — I begged, stayed patient, chased, and fought silently just to hold on to something that once made me feel the happiest. 
   But somewhere along the way, I lost myself…
</p>
<p>
  I know you were going through your own struggles. You weren’t in the best mental space, and you said you didn’t have time. And honestly, I was happy whenever you did call, even if it was just for a moment. But deep down, I felt disrespected. I was showing up with effort and care, but it felt like I was being taken for granted. No one is ever too busy to send a two-second reply. And I found myself asking for the bare minimum — just basic human decency — and even that felt like too much for you.
I get being busy... but not forgetting. Not silence. Not making someone feel invisible. You used to care. You used to talk to me like I meant something. Now, I’m just... here. Waiting for replies that never come. Wondering what I did wrong. 
</p>

<p>
  I never asked for grand gestures. I didn’t even want constant attention. 
  But going days, even weeks, without a single message? Not even a ten-second check-in? 
  That silence said more than any words ever could.
</p>

<p>
  I still keep my phone next to me while sleeping hoping that your name would pop up, 
  still wait for your good morning texts/calls but they never came. 
</p>

 <p>
  When you went back home, I stayed here hoping, praying, wishing that everything would be okay for your family. 
  And every time you called — scared, anxious, or lonely — I was there. 
  No matter where I was, I picked up. I supported you in every way I could. 
  But looking back now… I think I was wrong. 
  It felt like once things started getting better on your end, you slowly began drifting away. 
  And in the end… what happened? You moved on. 
  While I was still hoping and praying for your family’s peace, you were already letting go of us.
 </p>

 <p> 
  I never had bad intentions. I never wished anything wrong for you — not even for a second. But I honestly didn’t think it would end like this. Not with you. Not like this.<br>
  Lately, I’ve been taking therapy. I needed it — because holding in all of this pain was starting to break me from the inside and giving me panic attacks. It got so intense that I couldn’t sleep at night, appetite became worse and the worst thing , I got rude to everyone around me. And slowly, I’m trying to heal, trying to understand, trying to breathe again. But some wounds… they take time.
 </p>

 <p><strong>
  Take care of yourself. And yes, don’t overthink too much. I genuinely want you to stay happy. Just… next time, please learn to respect someone who truly cares about you and worries for you. And please, stay aware of people around you in Bangalore — especially the men.
  And yes... I still love you. Maybe not in the same way, not with the same hope — but with the part of me that once believed in us. This is the last time I’ll say it… and I mean it. 
  If I knew that the airport hug will be our last hug, I’d have hugged you for little longer. 
  Thank you for all the good memories. I’ll cherish them forever.
  Goodbye — and I hope life treats you kindly.
 </strong></p>

    <p>
      Forever a Swiftie by your side,<br>
